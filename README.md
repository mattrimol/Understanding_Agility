# Understanding Agility

Agility is a fascinating and complex athletic attribute that is critically important for football players. Using data from the NFL Combine, I used linear regression to better understand the athletic attributes associated with agility.

One of the drills performed in the NFL Combine is the 20 yard shuttle run. This agility drill involves many components of athleticism such as straight line speed, change of direction, and explosiveness. Using results from other Combine tests that measured straight line speed, explosiveness, and body type, I used linear regression to uncover associations between these attributes and faster shuttle times.
